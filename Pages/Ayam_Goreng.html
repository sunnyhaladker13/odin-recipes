    <h1>Ayam Goreng</h1>
    <a href="../index.html">ðŸ‘ˆ Back to home</a>
<p>Indonesian fried chicken is a crispy and flavorful delight. Marinated in spices like turmeric, garlic, and coriander, 
    <br>it resonates with the South Indian love for fried chicken. The distinct Indonesian touch comes from the addition of 
    <br>ingredients like galangal and kaffir lime leaves, adding layers of aroma.</p>

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <p><strong>Prep time:</strong> 15 min</p>
    <p><b>Cook time:</b> 20 - 25 min</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
<li><b>For the chicken:</b></li>
<ul>
    <li>1 chicken leg quarter (or about 1/2 lb bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
</ul>
<li><b>For the Marinade:</b></li>
<ul>
    <li>1 shallot, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic</li>
    <li>1/2-inch piece of ginger, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1/2-inch piece of galangal (optional, but adds a nice flavor)</li>
    <li>1/2-inch piece of turmeric, peeled and roughly chopped (or 1/4 tsp turmeric powder)</li>
    <li>1/2 stalk lemongrass, white part only, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1 kaffir lime leaf (optional)</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
</ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Make the marinade:</b> In a mortar and pestle or a food processor, grind the 
        <br>shallot, garlic, ginger, galangal (if using), turmeric, lemongrass, and kaffir lime 
        <br>leaf (if using) into a smooth paste. Alternatively, you can finely mince everything 
        <br>with a knife.  Add the coriander powder, cumin powder, salt, and pepper, and mix 
        <br>well.</li>

        <li><b>Marinate the chicken:</b> Place the chicken in a bowl and add the marinade. Rub  
        <br>the marinade all over the chicken, ensuring it's well coated. Cover and  
        <br>refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or preferably longer (up to overnight) for 
        <br>maximum flavor.
        </li>

        <li><b>Cook the chicken:</b> Heat the oil in a skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Add  
        <br>the marinated chicken and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown and 
        <br>cooked through (about 20-25 minutes).  Ensure the internal temperature 
        <br>reaches 165Â°F (74Â°C).
        </li>

        <li><b>Rest & Serve:</b> Once cooked, remove the chicken from the pan and let it rest for  
        <br>a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute, making the  
        <br>chicken more tender.
        </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Crispy skin:</b> For extra crispy skin, you can pat the chicken dry with paper towels 
        <br>before frying.</li>
        <li><b>Frying temperature:</b> Maintain a consistent medium heat to ensure the chicken 
        <br>cooks evenly and doesn't burn.</li>
        <li><b>Frying temperature:</b> Maintain a consistent medium heat to ensure the chicken 
        <br>cooks evenly and doesn't burn.</li>
        <li><b>Doneness:</b> To check for doneness, pierce the thickest part of the chicken with a 
        <br>knife or thermometer. The juices should run clear, and the internal temperature
        <br>should be 165Â°F (74Â°C).</li>
        <li><b>Serving:</b> Serve your Ayam Goreng hot with Nasi Uduk, sambal, and your favorite
        <br>Indonesian side dishes.</li>
    </ul>

        <br>Indonesian fried chicken and is perfect for a satisfying single serving.</p>
